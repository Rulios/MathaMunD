MathaMund Project Code Source 


MathaMunD is a project focused on learning and developing 
some mathematical knowledges. This includes the important
systematical part of logical reasoning that mathematics 
includes.

On MathaMunD, we engage the interactivity with the user. Which 
means that the learning process in MathaMunD is not focused
on memorizing, it is focused on autonomy. Because the main
objective of MathaMunD is to emphatize the use of the mathematics
at the life.
